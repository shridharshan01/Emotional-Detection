# Emotional-Detection
This project uses DeepFace, a powerful deep learning facial analysis framework, along with OpenCV to detect and classify human emotions from facial images. The script analyzes static images to identify the dominant emotion expressed on a person's face and overlays that emotion label directly on the image.
